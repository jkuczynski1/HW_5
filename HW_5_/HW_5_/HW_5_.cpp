/* HW_5_.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

my sources are Rosettacode and the textbook. I am not directly applying rosettacode code as my own, 
but used it to double-check my thought process and influence my own. 

I will mention what each  piece of code does, and if it was influenced by rosettacode.
