/* HW_5_.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

my sources are Rosettacode and the textbook. I am not directly applying rosettacode code as my own, 
but used it to double-check my thought process and influence my own. 

I will mention what each  piece of code does, and if it was influenced by rosettacode.

	/*Now, seeing as I have run out of time, or am close to it, I plan to outline how I would have went 
	about the rest of my code. Most of the code for the individual functions above is not mine-
	I did not get a chance to edit the code, and please note that I do NOT implement code that
	is not mine without crediting sources. 
	
	Only the timecounter  and time implementation belong to me exclusively, after researching how the time aspect works.
	I would apply these to each iteration of the search functions, such that the time one started the search and the time 
	that a search was finished would be displayed to a user on the console.

	From there, I would implement each algorithm such that the timecounter would be incremented after 
	each sorting step, resulting in a correctly working counter-one for the number of exchanges. 
	For the number of comparisons, I would apply it to each test of the numbers in question instead of after each step.

	From there, at the end of a sort, I would write out the following to the console:

	cout << sortName << "\n" <<" Number of comparisons: " << NumOfComparisions << "\n" <<" Number of exchanges: " << NumOfEexchanges << endl;
wich I would then write into the table.

I would offer them to sort again, and repeat the process you see here, probably with a exit code "type q to quit", or something similar.
