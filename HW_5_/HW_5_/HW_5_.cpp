/* HW_5_.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

my sources are Rosettacode and the textbook. I am not directly applying rosettacode code as my own, 
but used it to double-check my thought process and influence my own. 

I will mention what each  piece of code does, and if it was influenced by rosettacode.

//firt thing-includes...these are the same as rosettacode as I fould including these made things much easier overall.

#include "stdafx.h"

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
